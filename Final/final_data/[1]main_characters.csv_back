Stannis Baratheon,"2, 3, 4, 5",20,100,100,Baratheon,"Stannis Baratheon,?Lord?of Dragonstone, is the elder of Robert Baratheon's younger brothers. A brooding, humorless man known for a hard and unyielding sense of justice, he is obsessed with slights real and imagined. With Robert dying, Ned sends him a letter appointing him as the legitimate heir and becomes another challenger for the Iron Throne after his nephew Joffrey becomes King. By Season 2, he has fallen under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are illegitimate and names himself King of the Seven Kingdoms. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the more charismatic Renly. When Renly is mysteriously slain, many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up the Blackwater Bay. However, due to Tyrion's plan using wild fire and reinforcements by the Lannisters and Tyrell Cavalry, he loses the Battle of Blackwater. Despite this setback, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she lets him see a vision of a battle in the flames. He acquires one of Robert's bastards, Gendry, from the Brotherhood Without Banners and plans to sacrifice him to further his quest for the Iron Throne. After Davos questions his course of action, Stannis has three leeches drawn with Gendry's blood and throws them into a fire, calling for the death of Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and Joffrey Baratheon. Upon the news of Robb's death, Davos releases Gendry to prevent him from being burned. Stannis subsequently sentences his Hand to death but is swayed by Melisandre, who encourages him to travel North to aid the Night's Watch against the threat emerging from beyond the Wall. In season 4, Stannis hears of Joffrey's death and chastises Davos again for releasing Gendry and not finding him a suitable army, prompting Davos to write to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis's name to help pay for an army. The Iron Bank very nearly refuses Stannis' request, even subtly belittling him in the process, but Davos manages to convince them that Stannis is easily the only one they can turn to since Tywin Lannister is nearing old age. Stannis and his army arrive at the Wall shortly after the Battle for Castle Black, interrupting a supposed parley between Jon Snow and Mance Rayder. Stannis learns that Jon is Ned Stark's son, and on Jon's advice, he places Mance and his men under arrest. He is later present at the funeral of the Night's Watch brothers who died during the Battle for Castle Black. In season 5, Stannis begins plans to retake the North from Roose Bolton, hoping to recruit Mance's wildling army, if Mance will bend the knee to him. Mance refuses, and Stannis orders him burned at the stake."
Tommen Baratheon,5,16,120,120,Baratheon,"Tommen Baratheon is the prince presented as the youngest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister. Like is older siblings Joffrey and Myrcella his actually father is his uncle Ser Jaime Lannister. Like his sister he is good-natured and passive in contrast to his brother Joffrey and is fond of his uncle Tyrion. In Season 2 When Myrcella was shipped of to Dorne as part of a marriage alliance with Lannister0-Dorne, Tommen wept when his sister left for which Joffrey chastise him for it. During the battle of the black water, he sat with Cersei as she prepares to give him night shade drops for a quick painless death rather than brutality, until Tywin announced that they won the battle. In Season 4 he is presented at Joffrey and Margaerys Wedding, he also attended Joffrey funeral for which Tywin proceeds to tell Tommen what makes a good king, ignoring Cersei's Angry glares. Margaery later visits Tommen one knight were he reveales his Pet Cat Ser Pounce, and for the fact that he and Joffrey didn't get along and he and Margaery bond over their mutual relief that they are free of him. Tommen agrees that he'd like Margaery to visit him again. Margaery departs, but not before giving a kiss on the forehead. A ceremony is held in the Red Keep where the high septon officially crowns Tommen as king. At Tyrion's Trial Tommen excuses himself from the trial possibly on 'Tywin's advice'. In Season 5 during the wake of his grandfather, Tommen is approached by Margaery, who shares a few close words with the king and holds his hand briefly. All of this is observed by Cersei from afar."
Joffrey Baratheon,"1, 2, 3, 4",26,140,140,Baratheon,"Joffrey Baratheon is the?Crown Prince?of the Seven Kingdoms. He is the eldest of Cersei Lannister's children and heir to the Iron Throne. Vicious and cruel, he has a short temper and believes he can do anything he wants. He is also a coward when confronted by those who aren't afraid of him. Joffrey is also unaware that King Robert is not his real father - who, in reality, is Jaime Lannister. After Robert's death, the Lannisters make Joffrey the King against his father's will, and Joffrey becomes a cruel ruler and a Puppet King used by his mother. Joffrey makes a mistake when, against Cersei's and Sansa's wishes, he refuses to honor his promise of sparing Ned; instead, Joffrey has him executed. His act worsens the situation with the Lannisters' war effort as Jaime is captured by the Starks and his uncles Renly and Stannis have challenged his claim to the Iron Throne. He frequently orders his Kingsguard to beat Sansa. His cruelty and ignorance of the commoners' suffering makes him unpopular after he orders the City Watch to kill all of his father's bastard children in King's Landing which would later lead to a riot where he is almost killed. When Stannis attacks King's Landing, Joffrey serves only as a figurehead and avoids the heavy fighting. When the battle eventually turns in Stannis' favor, Cersei calls her son into the safety of the castle, damaging the morale of his army. The battle is only won by his grandfather Tywin and the forces of House Tyrell. To cement the alliance between their families, Joffrey's engagement to Sansa is annulled so he can marry Margaery Tyrell. Upon the end of Season 3, the marriage is yet to take place, and rifts are growing between Joffrey and his uncle and grandfather, who are (in their respective ways) rebutting his cruelty. He also seems to take little interest in his bride, but is amazed and altered by her ways of winning the people's favor, in which he takes part. In Season 4, Joffrey finally marries Margaery, but he dies at the wedding after being poisoned, and his uncle Tyrion is accused and arrested. It is confirmed, however, he was poisoned by Olenna Tyrell, with assistance from Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard, as she wanted to protect Margaery from the physical and emotional abuse that Joffrey had very clearly inflicted on Sansa. Olenna later confides to Margaery that she would never have let her marry ""that beast"". Following Joffrey's funeral, his younger brother and heir, Tommen, is crowned King."
Robert Baratheon,1,7,160,160,Baratheon,"Robert Baratheon, formerly a fierce warrior, became?King?of the Seven Kingdoms after leading a rebellion against Aerys II Targaryen. He was betrothed to Ned Stark's sister Lyanna and loved her deeply, and she was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen. Her father and another brother were killed when they went to King's Landing to reclaim her, which resulted in Robert and Ned Stark's revolt known as Robert's Rebellion, whereupon the Targaryens were all slaughtered or routed from the Kingdoms. Since Robert's family had closer ties to the former Royal family, this put Robert on the Iron Throne. Now, Robert has grown fat and miserable; he has no more wars to fight, is surrounded by plotters and sycophants, hates and is bored by the constant work needed to manage the Kingdoms properly, and trapped in a political marriage to the scheming Cersei Lannister, whom he has never loved. He is unaware that none of his three children are his, but instead Jaime Lannister's. Under his reign, the realm has been bankrupted, and Robert is deeply in debt to his wife's family. Killed while hunting, he unknowingly leaves no rightful heir behind. His bastards are ordered dead by Joffrey, many of which are killed, and Gendry is subsequently forced to flee the capital."
Theon Greyjoy,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",27,180,180,Greyjoy,"Theon Greyjoy is the youngest son of Lord Balon Greyjoy of the Iron Islands. He is the hostage and ward of Lord Eddard Stark, stemming from the failed Greyjoy Rebellion. Despite his position, he remains loyal to Eddard and is good friends with his sons Robb and Jon. While he has never questioned his position, he soon begins to have doubts after Tyrion tells him he is nothing more than a servant to the Starks and not everyone respects him. Nevertheless, Theon initially remains loyal to Robb after he goes to war with the Lannisters and supports his decision to have the North secede from the Seven Kingdoms and form their own kingdom. He is sent to the Iron Islands in Season 2 to seek a Stark alliance with the Greyjoys. However, his father criticizes Theon for accepting the northern lifestyle and rejects Robb's proposal. Wishing to prove to his father that he is a true Ironborn, he joins his family's invasion of the North. To gain the respect of his men, he ignores his orders to raid the shores and captures Winterfell. The situation worsens for Theon when he is forced to kill his old mentor Ser Rodrik Cassel and fakes the deaths of Bran and Rickon Stark to the people of Winterfell after they escape by killing two orphans. Regretting what he has done and with no help coming from his family, Theon decides to die fighting with his men defending Winterfell from a Stark force led by Roose Bolton's bastard son. However, he is betrayed by his men due to Robb's offer of clemency and safe return to the Iron Islands if they give up Theon. Theon is taken captive and kept in an unknown castle, but later manages to escape with the help of a serving boy that works for his sister Yara. He is brought back to the very castle he escaped from, the serving boy proving to be his captor and torturer, Ramsay Snow, Lord Bolton's bastard. Theon is subsequently brutally tortured, flayed and eventually castrated by Ramsay, who forces him to rename himself Reek, and beats him until he submits to his new name (before his castration he told Ramsay that he regretted betraying Robb and calls Ned Stark his ""real father""). Theon's penis is sent in a box to his father, threatening to mutilate Theon further unless the Ironmen retreat from the North, which Balon refuses. He states that as Theon defied him by attacking Winterfell, claiming him a ""fool"" and ""not a man anymore"", to which Yara responds she intends to save her brother of her own accord. In season 4, Theon has been freed from his restraints by Ramsay, but is forced to work for him as a servant and answer to the name Reek. Roose Bolton later orders Ramsay to launch an attack on Moat Cailin, an Ironborn-occupied fortress that is preventing him from entering the Northern lands, and to take Theon with him. Before they leave, however, the Dreadfort is attacked by Yara and a group of men, but Theon refuses to flee with her, believing it may be another trick on Ramsay's part, forcing Yara to leave without him. As a reward, Ramsay gives Theon a bath and asks for his help in taking Moat Cailin. Theon masquerades as himself and tricks the Ironborn into opening Moat Cailin, leading to them all being flayed by the Bolton army, and subsequently accompanies the Boltons to Winterfell."
Tyrion Lannister,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",40,200,200,Lannister,"Nicknamed ""The?Imp"", Tyrion Lannister is the younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. He is a?dwarf; and his mother died during his birth, for which his father,?Tywin Lannister, blames him. While not physically powerful, Tyrion has a cunning mind and often uses to his advantage the fact that others constantly underestimate him. Initially, Tyrion bears the Starks no ill will, but after being wrongly captured and put on trial for the crime of murdering Jon Arryn and conspiring to kill Bran Stark, both of which he had no hand in or knowledge of, his ire toward Lady Catelyn prompts him to join his father's war against the Starks. At the end of the Lannister army's first loss against Robb Stark's army, after Jaime Lannister is captured, they learn that King Joffrey has killed Ned Stark against their wishes and Robert's brothers are challenging Joffrey's claim to the throne. To ensure that someone trusted controls Joffrey while he deals with the war effort, Tywin sends Tyrion to rule in his stead as Hand of the King, finally taking notice of his ""lesser"" son's cunning intellect. He arrives in King's Landing and immediately enters a bitter power struggle with Cersei and Joffrey, methodically removing the Queen's supporters from positions of power. With his small army of hill tribesmen and his mercenary friend Bronn leading the City Watch, he becomes one of the most powerful men in the city. Before Stannis' fleet arrives at King's Landing, Tyrion prepares the attack by stockpiling large quantities of Wild Fire, putting it all in a single ship, and sending it towards Stannis' fleet. Bronn detonates the Wild Fire, causing a giant explosion and destroying half of Stannis' forces. When the city's defenders morale drops after Joffrey abandons them, Tyrion rallies the men and leads a surprise counterattack against the besiegers. During the battle, he is betrayed and nearly killed by a member of the Kingsguard under the orders of Joffrey, but he is saved by his squire Podrick Payne. When he wakes up after the battle is over, Tyrion learns that his father Tywin has taken over as Hand of the King and stripped his son of all power and all the allies he had gained. Furthermore, Tyrion's role in helping defend King's Landing is completely discounted for. Despite this setback and his lover Shae's telling him to leave Westeros, Tyrion still wants to stay, since he has finally found something he both excels at and enjoys¡ªout-talking and out-thinking his less than noble family members. In Season Three, Tyrion is given the job of Master of Coin, a role that he is unprepared and inexperienced for. Tyrion is commanded by his father to marry Sansa Stark; however, on the wedding night, Tyrion refuses to consummate his marriage and instead lets Sansa sleep alone, promising not to touch her unless she wanted him to. The death of her brother Robb, in which Tyrion took no part, causes a further rift between the couple and between Tyrion and his father, who he claims can't distinguish between his interests and his often-praised ideal of devotion to family. Tywin bitterly claims that he had wanted to drown Tyrion upon birth, but stayed himself for the sake of duty. In season 4, Tyrion welcomes Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne to King's Landing for Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, though Oberyn implies to Tyrion that his true purpose is to seek vengeance for his sister, who was murdered by Ser Gregor Clegane on Tywin's orders. When Joffrey is fatally poisoned, Tyrion is framed and arrested, though several people, such as Jaime, Bronn and Sansa, do not believe he committed the crime (Olenna Tyrell, Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard were responsible). Tyrion, however, implies that Cersei knows of his innocence and just wants him dead. At Tyrion's trial, several witnesses give either incomplete or false testimonies which seem to bolster the case against Tyrion. Tyrion finally loses his temper and lashes out at the entire court, wishing that he had killed Joffrey and left them all to die when Stannis attacked, and demands a trial by combat. When Jaime and Bronn prove unavailable, Tyrion is approached by Oberyn, who volunteers to be his champion in order to fight Cersei's champion, Ser Gregor Clegane. When Oberyn loses the fight and is killed, Tyrion is sentenced to death. Jaime, however, frees Tyrion and arranges for him to escape King's Landing. Tyrion goes to confront Tywin in his chambers but finds Shae, who testified against him and is now Tywin's lover. After a brief struggle, Tyrion strangles Shae to death, and finds Tywin in a privy. The two share a tense conversation, in which Tywin insults Shae once too many times, and Tyrion shoots Tywin to death with Joffrey's crossbow. Tyrion is then placed in a crate and smuggled off to Essos with help from Varys. They arrive in Pentos, where Varys manages to convince Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen and aid Daenerys Targaryen in retaking the Iron Throne."
Jaime Lannister,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",31,220,220,Lannister,"Ser Jaime Lannister is a member of the Kingsguard and an exceptionally skilled?swordsman. He is the Queen's twin brother and has carried on an incestuous love affair with her all his life, fathering all three of her living children. He truly does love his sister and will do anything, no matter how rash, to stay close to her. He is nicknamed ""Kingslayer"" for killing the previous King, Aerys II, whom he was sworn to protect. He was allowed to keep his post in the current Kingsguard as he and his influential father helped Robert win the war, but no one feels he deserves this post, which frustrates Jaime. Despite Eddard Stark's animosity against him for forsaking his oath to protect the King during Robert's Rebellion, Jaime has great respect for Eddard, whom he considers a great warrior and his equal. Unlike his father and sister, Jaime cares deeply about his younger brother Tyrion. When Tyrion is arrested by Catelyn, Jaime confronts Eddard and duels him, much to Jaime's joy. But to his displeasure, one of his men interferes with the fight by spearing Eddard, whereupon Jaime punches the man and lets Eddard live. Jaime later joins his father's campaign in the Riverlands as a revenge for Catelyn's actions by leading an army. However, his army is ambushed by Robb's army and Jaime is made prisoner of the Starks. Despite his capture, Cersei names him Lord Commander of the Kingsguard after Barristan Selmy is dismissed. In Season 2, Catelyn releases and sends Jaime to King's Landing under Brienne of Tarth's watch in exchange for a pledge to send her daughters home. On the journey, they are captured by the violent Locke, a man-at-arms under Roose Bolton, a Northern Lord. On their way to Harrenhal, now held by Bolton, the lowborn Locke cuts off Jaime's sword hand to taunt his position and privilege. Jaime survives and is allowed to depart Harrenhal on condition that he acquits Bolton from any guilt (unbeknownst to him, Bolton had conspired with Tywin and Walder Frey to assassinate Robb Stark, an alliance put in jeopardy by Locke's actions). During his time in Harrenhal, Jaime reveals to Brienne on why he killed King Aerys II; Aerys planned to burn King's Landing by igniting a large stock of Wildfire hidden under the city to ensure its destruction; Jaime killed the King to prevent the Wildfire plot and didn't tell Ned Stark the truth, knowing he wouldn't listen to an oathbreaker. After Bolton's departure, Jaime returns to Harrenhal just in time to save Brienne from Locke, who intended to feed her to his bear rather than accept her father's offer for a ransom. Locke reluctantly allows them to leave rather than kill Jaime as well, knowing it would earn him the enmity of Boltons as well as Lannisters. Jaime travels to King's Landing with Brienne and disgraced Maester Qyburn, given by Bolton to tend to his injury, in tow. At the end of Season 3, they arrive at the gates and Jaime reunites with Cersei, who is visibly shocked at his missing hand. In season 4, Jaime is fitted with a golden prosthetic hand and given a new sword, and is trained by Bronn in fencing with his left hand. He is present at the royal wedding that results in Joffrey's death (which Tyrion is arrested for), as well as the funeral. Jaime is one of the few people in King's Landing who believe in Tyrion's innocence, and does his best to comfort his younger brother, while outright refusing Cersei's order to kill Tyrion before his trial. At the trial, Jaime is visibly uncomfortable at the lies the witnesses are telling and confronts Tywin. In desperation, Jaime agrees to step down from the Kingsguard and serve as Tywin's heir if he spares Tyrion and exiles him to the Night's Watch instead of executing him. When Tyrion is sentenced to death, Jaime frees Tyrion from captivity and arranges for him to be smuggled to Essos with Varys's help, bidding his little brother farewell with a hug. This leads to Tywin's murder at Tyrion's hands, for which Cersei holds Jaime partly responsible. Jaime pays his respects at Tywin's funeral."
Cersei Lannister,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",40,240,240,Lannister,"Cersei Lannister,?Queen?of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, is the wife of?King?Robert Baratheon. Her father arranged the marriage when she was a teenager, initiating himself as a political counselor for King Robert. The Lannisters are the richest family in Westeros,[4]?which is why Robert was interested in a marriage between them. Cersei has a twin brother, Jaime, with whom she has been involved in an incestuous affair from early childhood. All three of Cersei's children are Jaime's.[4]Cersei's main character attribute is her desire for power and her deep loyalty to her father, children, and brother Jaime. Cersei learns that her husband Robert is in danger of finding out that the children he sees as his heirs to the throne are not his. Robert meets his end as the result of a boar attack on a hunting trip, before Ned Stark tells him of the truth about his children. Cersei works quickly to instate her oldest son, Joffrey, on the throne, with her as his chief political advisor and Queen Regent.[5]?Joffrey quits listening to his mother, and by the beginning of the second season her father decides Cersei does not exercise enough control over her son, and her father sends his youngest son Tyrion as an additional political advisor. Cersei and Tyrion do not get along, and constantly try to undermine each other's authority over the crown. As of the end of season 2, Tyrion has accumulated more sway over the Iron Throne, and has shipped Cersei's only daughter off against Cersei's will to be married to the prince of Dorne. In season 3, she takes pleasure in Tyrion's diminished position and taunts him for being forced into a marriage pact with Sansa Stark, only to be told by her father that he intends to marry her to Loras Tyrell. At the end of the season, the two siblings ponder at their respective marriages, and Cersei reunites with Jaime in her bedchamber as he unexpectedly returns from captivity. In season 4, she has Tyrion arrested after Joffrey is fatally poisoned. It is implied that she knows Tyrion's guilt is highly unlikely, but just wants to see him dead, though Jaime refuses to carry out the order.[6]?Indeed, at Tyrion's trial, it is obvious that Cersei has manipulated the entire procedure so that the only witnesses (herself, Lord Varys, Meryn Trant, Grand Maester Pycelle and Shae) give either incomplete or entirely false testimonies to implicate Tyrion and Sansa further in the murder. When Tyrion demands a trial by combat, Cersei quickly chooses Ser Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane as her champion to diminish Tyrion's chances of acquittal, and has Bronn betrothed to a noblewoman so that Tyrion cannot choose him as his champion. Cersei's wish comes true when Tyrion's champion, Oberyn Martell, is killed by Clegane, but she still refuses to marry Loras, even threatening her father with revealing the truth about her relationship with Jaime and the parentage of her children. Tywin rebuffs her threats, though he himself is killed by an escaping Tyrion soon afterwards. Cersei attends Tywin's funeral and later orders a bounty on Tyrion's head."
Tywin Lannister,"2, 3, 4, 5",27,260,260,Lannister,"Lord?of Casterly Rock, Shield of Lannisport and Warden of the West, Tywin is a calculating, ruthless, and controlling man. He is also the former Hand of King Aerys II. He is the father of Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion. After Eddard Stark's arrest, Joffrey names him Hand of the King once more, but after Jaime is taken captive by the Starks, Eddard is unexpectedly executed by Joffrey, and Renly and Stannis Baratheon challenge Joffrey's claim to the throne; Tywin elects to remain in the field commanding his forces until he wins his war, and in the meantime gives the position of Hand of the King to Tyrion. Tywin continues the war through Season 2 at Harrenhal where he criticizes his commanders for losing and underestimating the Stark army led by King Robb Stark. While there, he forms an unlikely friendship with his cup bearer, unaware that she is actually Arya Stark. Originally, he was about to attack Robb's forces while they are distracted by the Greyjoys seizing Winterfell, but changes his mind and helps the defenders of King's Landing drive Stannis Baratheon's forces away. He assumes his position of Hand of the King once again and arranges for Joffrey to marry Margaery Tyrell to secure an alliance between the Lannisters and Tyrells. In the third season, as Hand of the King, he fortifies his position as?de facto?leader of the Seven Kingdoms, and he successfully defeats Robb Stark, the King in the North, by forging an alliance with the lords Frey and Bolton, who betray and kill Stark and his men. The crown subsequently pardons and rewards them with Riverrun and the North, respectively, though Tywin is criticized by Tyrion for winning the war through such an unscrupulous scheme. He also has to deal with an increasingly belligerent Joffrey, who chides his grandfather as a coward who ""hid under Casterly Rock"" while Robert Baratheon led the rebellion against Aerys Targaryen and secured the throne. Tywin's relations to his children are also complicated as he forces them into marriage alliances with Sansa Stark and Loras Tyrell, to secure the support of the Tyrells and Lannister dominion in the North (now Sansa's heirdom, as all her brothers are presumed dead). In the fourth season, Tywin is present at the royal wedding where Joffrey dies, but it is not made clear if he truly believes in Tyrion's guilt. He has King's Landing closed off to prevent Sansa from escaping (although she escapes with help from Petyr Baelish and Dontos Hollard). He later grooms Joffrey's younger brother, Tommen, to becoming the new King, and appears determined to make sure Tommen becomes a much better King than Joffrey was. In the meantime, Tywin faces his own problem in the form of Prince Oberyn Martell of Dorne, who is also the brother of the late Elia Targaryen, who was raped and butchered by Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane during the end of Robert's Rebellion, which Oberyn suspects was done on Tywin's order. Tywin briefly suspects Oberyn, who previously studied poison chemistry to become a maester, of having conspired with Tyrion to poison Joffrey as revenge for Elia, but Oberyn denies any involvement, while Tywin claims that he did not order the Mountain to murder Elia. Nevertheless, Tywin promises Oberyn a meeting with the Mountain in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the judges at Tyrion's trial. At the trial, when several supposed witnesses give false statements regarding Tyrion's supposed guilt, Tywin promises Jaime in private that if Tyrion is found guilty and pleads for mercy, he will exile him to the Night's Watch. However, Tyrion loses his composure, lashes out at Tywin and demands a trial by combat, to Tywin's anger. When Tyrion's champion, Oberyn, loses the fight and is killed, Tywin sentences Tyrion to execution. Later, when Jamie helps Tyrion escape, Tyrion discovers that Tywin was having an affair with Shae, Tyrion's former lover and who falsely testified against him at his trial. Tywin is ambushed by Tyrion while in a privy, wielding Joffrey's crossbow. Tywin attempts to reason with Tyrion, swearing that he would never have had him executed, but at the same time dismissing Shae as a mere sex worker. In his rage, Tyrion shoots Tywin twice in the chest, killing him. His body is discovered shortly afterwards, and a grand funeral is held for him in the Sept of Baelor."
Jon Snow,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",36,280,280,Stark,"Jon Snow is the?bastard son?of Ned Stark who joins the Night's Watch. Jon is a talented fighter, but his sense of compassion and justice brings him into conflict with his harsh surroundings. Ned claims that Jon's mother was a wet nurse named Wylla. His?dire wolf?is called Ghost due to his albinism and quiet nature. Jon soon learns that the Watch is no longer a glorious order, but is now composed mostly of society's rejects, including criminals and exiles. Initially, he has only contempt for his low-born brothers of the Watch, but he puts aside his prejudices and befriends his fellow recruits, especially Sam Tarly, after they unite against the cruel master-at-arms. He chooses to take his vows before the Old God of the North, and to his disappointment he is made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger. He eventually realizes that he is being groomed for command. He saves Mormont's life by slaying a wight, a corpse resurrected by the White Walkers. In return, he receives Longclaw, the ancestral blade of House Mormont. When Eddard is arrested for treason, Jon is torn between his family and his vows. After Eddard's execution, he tries to join Robb's army but is convinced to come back by his friends. Shortly after, he joins the large force Mormont leads beyond the Wall. Jon is part of a small scouting party in Season 2. When the party is overtaken by wildlings, Jon is ordered to appear to defect and join the wildlings so he can discover their plans. On affirming his loyalty to the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, he travels toward the Wall with the wildlings and is seduced by one, the flame-haired Ygritte. Upon crossing the wall, he refuses to behead a farmer whose escape might alert the Night's Watch of their coming, and is subsequently branded an enemy of the wildlings. Ygritte shields him from her comrades but ultimately confronts and injures Jon when he stops to drink. He manages to escape back to the wall, injured by three arrows, where he reunites with his comrades and informs the commanders of Mance Rayder's plans. Jon subsequently resumes his training at the Wall and suggests an expedition to Craster's Keep in order to kill the Night's Watch mutineers who may tell Mance of the Wall's weak defences if caught. Jon's request is granted and he bands together a group of rangers to aid him, among them the new recruit Locke, who has actually come to kill Jon on Roose Bolton's orders. Jon successfully attacks Craster's Keep and kills the mutineers, while Locke is killed by Hodor during an attempt to kill Bran, who was captive at Craster's Keep. However, Jon's proposal to barricade the entrance to Castle Black to stop the wildlings from entering is denied. He survives the wildling attack on Castle Black, personally killing Styr and taking Tormund Giantsbane prisoner. In the aftermath, he departs Castle Black to hunt down Mance Rayder, giving his sword to Sam. He quickly locates Mance on the pretence of parleying, but he is found out. Before he is killed, however, Jon is saved by the timely arrival by Stannis Baratheon, who places Mance and his men under arrest, and accompanies Jon back to Castle Black. Jon later burns Ygritte's body in the woods. In Season 5, Stannis attempts to use Jon as an intermediary between himself and Mance, hoping to rally the wildling army to help him retake the North from Roose Bolton and gain Jon's support in avenging his family. Jon fails to convince Mance, and when Mance is burned at the stake, Jon shoots him from afar to give him a quick death."
Sansa Stark,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",35,300,300,Stark,"Sansa Stark is the first daughter and second child of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. She was also the future bride of Prince Joffrey, and thus the future Queen of the Seven Kingdoms as well. Her?direwolf?is called Lady, she is the smallest of the pack. Sansa is naive and wants to live the life of a fairy tale princess and is unwilling to see the harsh realities of the kingdom's politics and rivalries. Her fantasy begins to shatter when Lady is killed, and the situation continues to worsen when her father is arrested for treason. She becomes a hostage to the Lannisters in order for them to have a legitimate claim for the North. Her naivete is finally shattered when King Joffrey executes her father despite promising her that he would spare him. Sansa is forced to put up an act or endure Joffrey's cruelty. Throughout Season 2, she suffers under Joffrey's abuse until Tyrion puts a stop to it. By the Season 2 finale, Joffrey breaks his engagement with Sansa to marry Margaery Tyrell. However, she is still a hostage; but Petyr Baelish promises to help her return to Winterfell. In Season 3, she is married to Tyrion to secure the Lannisters the North should Robb Stark die. The marriage is unhappy and yet to be consummated, and after Robb's death ¨C upon which Joffrey insists to be given his head to present to Sansa, a request coldly ignored by his grandfather ¨C she is unable to speak to him. In Season 4, Sansa has been mourning her family for weeks and is starving herself in depression. She attends Joffrey's wedding with Tyrion and witnesses Joffrey's death. Dontos Hollard immediately spirits her away from the wedding, moments ahead of Cersei's orders to have her and Tyrion arrested. Dontos brings Sansa to a ship concealed in fog, and she is greeted by Petyr Baelish. Under the guise of making payment, Petyr has the fool killed by his archers, with Petyr explaining that killing Dontos was the only way to ensure his silence - her disappearance when Joffrey died, the execution of her father, deaths of her family and years of torment at the king's hand, will all be considerable motive for Sansa helping Tyrion murder Joffrey. Currently, a thousand of the City Watch are searching for her, Cersei thirsts for vengeance, and Tyrion himself stands trial. Sansa is assured she has finally escaped King's Landing and is safe with Lord Baelish, who takes her to her Aunt Lysa for shelter. Lysa takes Sansa in warmly and has her betrothed to her son, Robin. However, Sansa realises the worst is far from over when Lysa, who is smitten with Petyr, accuses Sansa of trying to seduce him, and she discovers that Robin is a spoiled and rude child, slapping him at one point. When Petyr unexpectedly kisses Sansa, Lysa becomes enraged and nearly pushes Sansa through the castle's Moon Door, but Petyr intervenes by pacifying Lysa and then pushing her through the Moon Door to her death before Sansa's eyes, making Sansa realise that Petyr may have romantic or lustful feelings for her. Sansa speaks up for Petyr when he is questioned about his involvement in Lysa's death, but Sansa reaffirms Petyr's claim that Lysa killed herself due to her own instability and insecurities. Afterward she told Petyr that her reason to protect him in the hearing was because she knew he was the only person she could count on to protect her, demonstrated by his initiative in getting her out of King's Landing while everyone else in power there only wanted to use her as a pawn. In Season 5, she and Petyr leave the Eyrie for a place Petyr promises where Cersei will never find her."

She is later disguised as an orphan boy by Yoren, a Night's Watch recruiter, in hopes of getting her back to Winterfell. From then on, she takes the name Arry. During Season 2, Yoren's convoy is attacked by the Lannisters who are under orders by King Joffrey to find and kill Robert's bastard children. Before she is captured, she releases the prisoner Jaqen H'ghar and two others, saving their lives. She and the rest of the captured recruits are sent to Harrenhal under Gregor Clegane who cruelly tortures and kills prisoners everyday. At the same time, she follows the advice of the late Yoren and makes a list of those she wants dead like a prayer. When Tywin Lannister arrives at Harrenhal, he orders the killing of prisoners stopped and makes Arya his cup bearer after figuring out she is a girl. Tywin forms an unlikely friendship with Arya due to her intelligence while remaining unaware of her true identity. Arya reunites with Jaqen who offers to kill three lives in exchange for the three lives she saved.

After she fails to find Jaqen to kill Tywin, after he heads out to face Robb's forces, she forces Jaqen to help her, Gendry and Hot Pie escape Harrenhal after choosing Jaqen as her third name, for which she promises to ""unname"" him if he helps them. After successfully escaping, Jaqen gives her an iron coin and tells her to give it to any Braavosi and say ""Valar morghulis"" if she ever needs to find him. Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie head north for Riverrun and Arya's mother Lady Stark, but are captured by the Brotherhood Without Banners and taken to the Inn of the Kneeling Man. There, Arya is horrified to be reunited with the vile Sandor Clegane, one of the Brotherhood's prisoners. Arya and Gendry travel with the Brotherhood to meet their leader, now friends with them as they know Arya is Ned Stark's daughter. She escapes them after the Brotherhood acquits Sandor Clegane of murder after a trial by combat and selling Gendry to Melisandre to be sacrificed. Captured by Sandor, she is taken to the Twins to be ransomed to her brother, only to see his wolf and forces slaughtered and her brother paraded headless on a horse.

In season 4, Sandor decides to ransom her to her Aunt Lysa Arryn in the Vale. With Sandor's help, Arya later retrieves her sword, Needle (a gift from Jon Snow), and kills the sadistic soldier Polliver, who stole it from her. Along the way, Arya slowly begins to bond with Sandor, helping to heal one of his wounds when they are attacked. They eventually arrive at the Vale, but are told that Lysa Arryn killed herself three days prior. Arya laughs with disbelief. Later, Arya and Sandor are found by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne. Arya refuses to leave with Brienne, assuming her to be an agent of the Lannisters.

Born to the Lord and Lady of the Riverlands, she is the elder sister of Lysa Arryn, Lady of the Vale and Mistress of the Eyrie, and Lord Edmure Tully, Lord of Riverrun. After deducing that the Lannisters are responsible for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, she travels to King's Landing to warn Ned, and on her return trip has a chance encounter with Tyrion Lannister. Since Catelyn does not know about Tyrion's complete innocence, she decides to take him captive because she believes that he is behind the attempt on her son's life. She takes him to her sister, Lysa Arryn, so that he can be brought to justice but is not successful, as Tyrion is found innocent after a trial by combat.

Robb becomes involved in the war against the Lannisters after his father, Ned Stark, is arrested for treason. Robb summons his bannermen for war against House Lannister and marches to the Riverlands. Eventually, crossing the river at the Twins becomes strategically necessary. To win permission to cross, Robb agrees to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, Lord of the Twins. Robb leads the war effort against the Lannisters and successfully captures Jaime. After Ned is executed, the North and the Riverlands declare their independence from the Seven Kingdoms and proclaim Robb as their new King, ""The King in The North"". He wins a succession of battles in Season 2, earning him the nickname the Young Wolf. However, he feels that he botched the political aspects of war. He sends Theon to the Iron Islands hoping that he can broker an alliance with Balon Greyjoy, Theon's father. In exchange for Greyjoy support, Robb as King in the North will recognize the Iron Islands' independence. He also sends his mother Catelyn to deal with Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon, both of whom are fighting to be the rightful king. Theon and Catelyn fail in their missions, and Balon launches an invasion of the North. Robb falls in love with Talisa Maegyr, a healer from Volantis due to her kindness and spirit. Despite his mother's protest, Robb breaks his engagement with the Freys and marries Talisa in the 2nd season finale.

While at Riverrun, Robb makes the decision to execute Lord Rickard Karstark for the murders of two teenage squires related to the Lannisters, a decision that loses the support of the Karstarks and leads Robb to make the ultimately fatal decision to ask the Freys for their alliance. He is killed in the Red Wedding Massacre, after witnessing the murder of his pregnant wife and their child.

His corpse is later decapitated and Grey Wind's head is sewn on and paraded around as the Stark forces are slaughtered by the Freys and the Boltons."
Talisa Stark,3,11,400,400,Stark,"Talisa is a healer working on the battlefields of the War of the Five Kings. She claims to be from the Free City of Volantis. No character named Talisa appears in the books. Oona Chaplin was originally announced to play a character called Jeyne, which many thought to mean she would play Jeyne Westerling, a character from the books. Talisa follows Robb Stark's army camp as it moves. One day as they talk they are interrupted by news that Catelyn has released Robb's key prisoner Jaime Lannister. Talisa later goes to comfort Robb.

Eddard Stark,1,10,420,420,Stark,"Eddard ""Ned"" Stark,?Lord?of Winterfell and Warden of the North, becomes the Hand of the King after Lord Jon Arryn's death. He is known for his sense of honor and justice. He took part in Robert's Rebellion after his sister Lyanna was kidnapped by Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. When Ned's father and brother went south to reclaim her, the ""Mad King"" Aerys Targaryen burned both of them alive. Ned and Robert Baratheon led the rebellion to unseat him from the throne. As the show opens, Ned has been content to remain in the north, but after the death of Lord Jon Arryn, he is convinced that it is his duty to accept the position of Hand of the King. Ned is not interested in politics, and prefers to rule with honor and follow the law. While investigating the reason for the death of Jon Arryn, he discovers that all three of Robert's children with Queen Cersei were fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime. When Ned confronts Cersei about the truth, she has him imprisoned for treason after he publicly denounces Joffrey. Ned is convinced by Varys that if he goes to his death honorably, as he is prepared to do, his daughters will suffer for it. To protect them, he sacrifices his honor and publicly declares that he was plotting to steal the throne and that Joffrey is the true king. Despite Cersei's promise that Ned would be allowed to join the Night's Watch in exile, Joffrey orders Ned's execution for his own amusement and later torments Sansa by forcing her to look at her father's head. His bones are later returned to Catelyn in the Stormlands by Petyr Baelish, who laments Ned's downfall and that he was too honorable to seize power through force, rather insisting the throne pass to Lord Stannis Baratheron, Robert's younger brother. Baelish's preferred course of action, revealed only to Ned, had been to seize Cersei and her children first and rule in Joffrey's name as Regent and Lord Protector. Ned's execution, however, is not in vain, since he notifies Stannis of the truth of Joffrey's parentage, and Stannis informs all of Westeros, which sets into motion the War of Five Kings against House Lannister."
Daenerys Targaryen,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5",36,440,440,Targaryen,"Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled?princess?of the?Targaryen dynasty. Also called ""the Stormborn"", she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For seventeen years, she has been under Viserys' care whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. In exchange for an army, Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, making her a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she manages to get past their barriers. She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is a smart leader and a kind man. After embracing the Dothraki culture, she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother. She later becomes pregnant with Drogo's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the ""Stallion Who Mounts the World"". After her brother's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo, leaving him in a permanent catatonic state, and forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Losing both her husband and son, Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake. She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo's body and steps into the fire herself. At the end of the night, after the fire is burned down, only the Khaleesi and three baby dragons remain. Taking them with her, Daenerys and what is left of her husband's tribe must find a way to gather new allies to protect themselves and reclaim the Iron Throne. She becomes the first female Dothraki leader. In Season 2, she is lost in the Red Waste, a stretch of barren land. She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth, where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquest of Westeros. While in the city, her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree, and she must visit the House of the Undying in order to get them back. She does so, killing Pyat Pree and releasing the dragons. In the second season's finale, she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for his role in helping Pyat Pree and has her horde loot as much as they can from Xaro's mansion in order to buy a ship. Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay, where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied. On her departure from the city, she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders. By the end of Season 3, although her power has not yet been tested, she has acquired the firm loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai, her remaining Dothraki brethren (and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki, who advise her) 2,000 'Second Sons' cavalrymen, 8,000 'Unsullied' elite infantry, and three rapidly growing dragons. The stay in Slaver's Bay has made her question her motives, however, and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well, donning the honorific ""Breaker of Chains"" as the slaves hold her to the sky, praising her as their?Mhysa, or ""Mother"". Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen, the last of the slave cities in Slaver's Bay, but realises that she is slowly losing control of her dragons, especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food. Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet, Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being. She eventually learns of Jorah's original purpose, which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon, and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution. After she receives too many complaints about her dragons, Daenerys, locks two of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon. Meanwhile, Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied. She considers freeing her dragons, but they attempt to attack her, making her realise that they are no longer loyal to her."
Viserys Targaryen,1,5,460,460,Targaryen,"Viserys Targaryen is the exiled?prince?and heir of the Targaryen dynasty. Known as ""The Beggar King"" for his search for an army to recapture his throne. A narcissist, he is arrogant and self-centered, caring only about himself and looking down on others especially to his sister Daenerys. In exchange for an army to help regain the Iron Throne, Viserys marries off his sister to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo and follows his horde's journey to the Dothraki capital to ensure Drogo will keep his end of the bargain. But as they journey, it becomes evident that Viserys does not have leadership skills to reclaim the throne as his arrogance and disrespect for the Dothraki does not win him any hearts. Furthermore, Daenerys, who he has always threatened throughout his life, starts to stand up to him. Realizing that Daenerys is loved by the Dothraki and her and Drogo's unborn son is prophet to unite the world, Viserys realizes that it is not he but Daenerys who will reclaim the Iron Throne. In a fit of drunken rage, he threatens Drogo to give him his army now or he will kill his unborn son. Having enough of his behavior, Drogo kills Viserys by giving him a ""Golden Crown""; molten gold poured over his head. Daenerys listlessly watches her brother's agonizing death, proclaiming that he wasn't a true dragon, as ""fire cannot kill a dragon""."
Margaery Tyrell,"2, 3, 4, 5",19,480,480,Tyrell,"Margaery is the only daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell, and has recently married the late King Robert's brother, Renly Baratheon, as part of House Tyrell¡¯s support for his bid to seize the Iron Throne from King Joffrey. Somewhere in her mid to late twenties, she is surprisingly canny and cunning. She is aware of her husband's homosexual orientation and inclinations towards her brother. Despite her knowledge of this, she actively attempts to become pregnant as to secure the alliance between their families. When Renly is killed, the Tyrells ally with House Lannister and she is planned to marry to King Joffrey. In a departure from her characterization in the novels, where her personal motivations are unclear, Margaery's naked ambition is made obvious. Upon arriving at King's Landing, she offers Sansa to marry her brother Loras, but the plot is thwarted and Sansa is married to Tyrion Lannister to secure the North should Robb Stark die. At the end of Season 3, her marriage to Joffrey is impending, though her influence over him appears to grow, causing friction between her and Queen Regent Cersei. Cersei coldly implies she could have her killed at any time. In season 4, Margaery and Joffrey are married, but Joffrey dies at the wedding after being poisoned. Since Margaery still cannot become queen this way, she is betrothed to Joffrey's younger brother and heir, Tommen, and visits him one night in his chamber to get to know him better. She is among the many people in King's Landing who believe Tyrion Lannister is not responsible for Joffrey's death, and her grandmother, Olenna Tyrell, confirms to her that it was she who orchestrated it, leaving Margaery visibly shocked, until Olenna claims that it was to protect her from Joffrey's abuse (which he had quite clearly inflicted on Sansa while she was betrothed to him). Margaery is later present at Tyrion's trial, where she is visibly uncomfortable at the possibility of Tyrion being punished for the crime her grandmother committed. After Tyrion kills Tywin and escapes, Margaery attends Tywin's funeral."
Olenna Tyrell,5,9,500,500,Tyrell,"Lady Olenna, better known as ""The Queen of Thorns"", is the sharp-witted grandmother of Loras and Margaery. Considered Tywin Lannister's female counterpart, Olenna is a matriarch and the real power behind House Tyrell. She has very progressive views where she feels women should be more involved in politics and is accepting of Loras' homosexuality where the people of Reach have no problems with it. After learning the abuses Sansa suffered by Joffrey, Olenna figured out that Margaery could avoid the same fate by using Joffrey's love of violence. Because she is fond of Sansa, and to prevent the other nobles from using Sansa as heir of the North, Olenna secretly plots to have Sansa marry Loras. But her plan is foiled by Loras himself, who accidentally reveals it to Littlefinger's spy. Tywin Lannister gets wind of the plot and stops it by having Sansa marry his son Tyrion and, to secure the Reach, orders his daughter Cersei to marry Loras. Lady Olenna is at first against Loras marrying Cersei because Cersei is too old and because of the scandal of her incestual affair with her twin brother Jaime. But after Tywin threatens to make Loras join the celibate Kingsguard, which would make Joffrey and Margaery's children the heirs of Reach, Olenna admits defeat and praises Tywin for getting the best of her. In season 4, however, Olenna conspires with Petyr Baelish to have Joffrey poisoned, so as to protect Margaery from Joffrey's beastly nature, and advises Margaery to become acquainted with her new match, Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's younger brother and heir, before Cersei turns him against her. She returns to Highgarden shortly afterwards."
